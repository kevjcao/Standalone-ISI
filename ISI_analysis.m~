%% Standalone ISI analysis (from main MEA code) - 2021-Jan-12, KJC
%% Notes
% 1. This code requires sorted spike data from Plexon saved in an excel
% format delineated as: 'SpikeTimes', 'Unit no.', 'channels. no.'; in that order. 

% 2. It will generate a new array named 'raw_units' with each unit's firing
% activity listed as a single Nx3 or Nx4 array where N is the no. of events. The
% rasters are created from just the first column of each unit's array (e.g.
% the spike times).

%% Conditions
% Analysis duration
Duration = 1;                                                               % 1 = analysis performed for a segment of the recording

% Parameters for PI & LRI calculation

% Plots and graphs

% Parameters for ISI analysis
